### About me
I am passionate about technology and enjoy being part of such a fast-paced industry, I have over 6 years
experience working with distributed systems, CI/CD, containerization, monitoring, Open-Shift,
Kubernetes, from design to implementation and maintenance, and automation from friendy staging to a
highly-available production environment.
